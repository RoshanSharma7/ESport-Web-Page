            <h4>Global trends in gaming</h4>
            <p>According to the report here are the possible global trends can be predicted,they are as follows:<br>
            Legal sports gambling goes mainstream
            Following the US Supreme Court’s decision of removing the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act in 2018, casinos, media companies, sports leagues, online gambling operators, fantasy sports start-ups and software providers have emerged as early winners in the market. Specifically, gaming operators have been ironing out massive contracts between professional sports leagues and individual teams which appear to be quite lucrative. Since the first legalization of sports betting, further legislation to authorize sports betting has passed in 13 states. Five more states and the District of Columbia are poised to start legal markets in the coming months, and similar bills are being considered in many other states.</p>

            <h4>Cloud gaming takes off</h4>
            <p>After mobile gaming expanded the market by making games accessible to billions of people across the globe (it remains the largest segment in 2019), cloud gaming offers a similar huge potential. Cloud gaming, in which any game can be played on any device without the consumer having to own the physical hardware required to process the game, presents a significant opportunity to expand the market for premium games beyond the current console and PC audience. Major gaming brands are looking for new ways to deliver gaming and are unveiling cloud gaming platforms. Faster internet along with 5G makes the technology feasible in more markets .</p>

            <h4>Cross-platform gaming becoming mainstream</h4>
            <p>With gaming publishers competing to expand their markets and potential audience, they are looking to create games that are played on a wide range of devices/platforms. Going forward, gamers are likely to focus more on which games they play and with whom and less on which devices they own. Players who enjoy playing with friends do not need to own the same gaming platform, be it PlayStation, Xbox, or PC, and so on.</p>

            <h4>Significant use of data analytics</h4>
            <p>Sports organisations must actively engage their different fan segments both inside and outside the game venue — they need to be agile, flexible and able to evolve their offerings. Data analytics offers the ability to give fans an exceptional experience, by getting the right content to individuals at the right time. Allowing real-time interaction and engagement, by creating relevant, consistent and personalized content helps establish a deeper connection with fans. During the game, viewers have the possibility to access instant replays, alternate views and closeup videos, vote for their favorite player, bookmark and comment. Data analytics is also used to improve public attendance and event monitoring, fine tune players, team playbooks, game plans and even to kickstart sales and promotions. Performance analytics is being used to identify weaknesses, track improvements and observe trends. Analytics is also helping professional sports teams prevent sports injuries by analyzing the data collected from wearable devices.</p>

            <h4> Skill-based games to expand more</h4>
            <p>Nazara Technologies CEO Manish Agarwal says: “Skill Based Games played for real money + Competitive multiplayer + eSports will drive the overall gaming market going forward”. Moving on the same track All India Gaming Federation CEO Roland Landers said “ Online Real Money Skill Gaming (RMG) Industry is now poised to grow exponentially owing to the rise in digitally rich consumers and financial inclusion. The Industry needs rational taxation, both on methodologies and rates based on International best practices and endorsement of the AIGF self-regulation charter that governs stakeholders, so that businesses continue to expand and attract investments.” Junglee Games CEO Ankush Gera expects “The skill gaming industry, with close to a billion dollars in annual revenues on the backbone of Rummy and Fantasy Sports, is one of the fastest growing digital verticals in India, already seeing close to 100percent year-on-year growth. This industry will continue to beat all projections. Gaming is the opportunity for a billion screens in India and it has fully arrived.”</p>

            <h4>Digital interaction supported gameplay preference will increase</h4>
            <p>Amid the global lockdown due to coronavirus where people are practicing social distancing digital interaction is the only option left people are enjoying gaming as it also open avenues to interact with dear ones. Therefore Khel Group co-founder Nitesh Damani says, “The idea of ‘Lone Gamer’ is not true any more. A lot of gaming and a lot of interaction is no longer physical; it’s all digital and at a distance. I think there’s been this rediscovery of the joy of playing with people around the table.”</p>

            <h4>Poker possibilities in India</h4>
            <p>According to Spartan Poker founder and managing director Amin Rozani , “There has been an upward trend in the growth of poker in India, especially over the past 2 years and we believe this will continue going ahead with great value offerings and top-notch customer service driving the way.”<br>ss
            Adda52 CEO Naveen Goyal “Poker is a mind sport, played responsibly to learn life skills, probability and business. Gaming can take one to success in multiple facets of life.”</p>

            <h4>Multiplayer games and casual games to follow the trend</h4>
            <p>India Game Developer Conference Convenor Rajesh Rao says , “While real money gaming continues to grow rapidly, success of PUBG shows people’s propensity to spend on multiplayer games and casual should follow. With India’s per capita income being around 1/5th of China, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to forecast a games market 1/6th of China, after adjusting for lower disposable income in India… This would mean a India market in the US$4-US$7 billion range.”</p>

            <h4>Gaming next level</h4>
            <p>Pocket Aces co-founder Anirudh Pandita says “Globally, gaming has become a centerpiece of the consumer entertainment experience today with US gaming industry revenues now outpacing Hollywood box office receipts and approaching TV revenues. In India, increasing smartphone penetration along with cheap data is fuelling growth in gaming. Big beneficiaries have been hardcore games and gaming platforms. We are at the beginning of a secular trend that will continue for a while and will result in the formation of a gaming, game streaming, and esports ecosystem.</p>
